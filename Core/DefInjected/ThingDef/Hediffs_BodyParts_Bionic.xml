  <!-- EN: bionic arm -->
  <BionicArm.label>แขนเทียมชีวกล</BionicArm.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial arm. Silenced mini-servos give great strength, while the biogel nerve-link gives exquisite control. A lattice-dust healing system allows it to recover from damage. It is better than a biological arm in almost every way. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic ear -->
  <BionicEar.label>หูเทียมชีวกล</BionicEar.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial ear implant. A collection of invisible subdermal microphones capture sound and transmit it to a biogel nerve interface that links directly with the auditory nerve. It's sensitive enough to hear a cat before you see it, can't be damaged by loud noise, and automatically tunes itself to pick out meaningful sounds in noisy environments. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic eye -->
  <BionicEye.label>ตาเทียมชีวกล</BionicEye.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial eye. With its biogel nerve-link, internal signal pre-processor, and wide-spectrum sensors, it is better than a biological eye in almost every way. A lattice-dust healing system allows it to recover from damage. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic heart -->
  <BionicHeart.label>หัวใจเทียมชีวกล</BionicHeart.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial heart. It has synthetic muscle fibers for a realistic heartbeat, plus a high-flow pump for rapid circulation during high stress. It is better than a biological heart in almost every way. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic leg -->
  <BionicLeg.label>ขาเทียมชีวกล</BionicLeg.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial leg. With its biogel nerve-link, powerful mini-servos, and lattice-dust healing system, it is better than a biological leg in almost every way. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic spine -->
  <BionicSpine.label>กระดูกสันหลังเทียมชีวกล</BionicSpine.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial spine. A biogel nerve bundle runs down an articulated plasteel core, surrounded by a lattice-dust healing system. It matches the performance of a biological spine. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic stomach -->
  <BionicStomach.label>กระเพาะเทียมชีวกล</BionicStomach.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced artificial stomach. A set of sensors and chemical synthesizers efficiently digest nearly any energy-bearing foodstuff. An integrated lattice-dust healing system automatically repairs any damage caused by the powerful acids. It is better than a biological stomach in almost every way. -->

  <!-- EN: bionic tongue -->
  <BionicTongue.label>TODO</BionicTongue.label>
  <!-- EN: An artificial tongue replacement. Made of synthetic smooth-fibers and connected through a neurogel interface, it can match the performance of a natural tongue in speaking, eating, and tasting. -->

  <!-- EN: death acidifier -->
  <DeathAcidifier.label>TODO</DeathAcidifier.label>
  <!-- EN: A chest implant for preventing enemy use of captured equipment. Upon the user's death, it releases powerful chemicals that dissolve gear in contact with the user's body. It doesn't damage others. -->
